# **Adding new names**

### Choosing the right path

From the front page of `WID`, navigate to `Filter Cards` panel, on the left:
1. Click on `Nomenclature`;
2. Then on `New`

You will notice that both `Nomenclature` and `New` will be highlighted in green.



At this point, the central panel will showo only 3 possible entries:
- `New combination`
- `New taxon name`
- `New typ specimen`

Click on `New taxon name` (number 3 in the image below), and you will be directed to another page.
